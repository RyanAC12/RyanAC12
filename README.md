### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ryan, and I am a soon-to-be graduate from The Ohio State University. I am a budding web developer passionate about creating efficient and aesthetically pleasing web applications. I am currently honing my skills through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), focusing on full-stack development with an interest in front-end technologies. With a background in linguistics, I bring a unique perspective to problem solving and programming, blending linguistic creativity with technical acumen.
